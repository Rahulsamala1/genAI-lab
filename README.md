# 🌟 genAI – Generative AI Playground

Welcome to **genAI**, a personal playground for experimenting with **Generative AI** models.  
From image creation to text generation, this repo is where imagination meets machine learning. 🧠✨

## 📚 What's Inside?

| Folder       | Description                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `VAE/`       | Variational Autoencoders – image compression & generation |
| `GANs/`      | (coming soon) Generative Adversarial Networks for high-quality image generation |
| `Transformers/` | (coming soon) Language & multimodal generation (e.g. GPT, BERT) |
| `Diffusion/` | (coming soon) SOTA models for detailed image/video generation |

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

This project is meant for:
- **Learning by doing** 🛠️
- **Trying cool generative models** (like ChatGPT, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion)
- **Visualizing how they work** using simple analogies (like food & recipes!)

If you're into creative AI, this repo is your digital lab. ⚗️

## 🧑‍🍳 Getting Started

Each folder includes:
- Beginner-friendly notebooks (run in Colab!)
- Simple code in PyTorch/TensorFlow
- Clear, intuitive explanations

> You don’t need to be a deep learning guru. Just a curious mind and a love for experimentation.

---

## 🚧 Coming Soon

- Face generation with CelebA (VAE & GAN)
- Text-to-image using Stable Diffusion
- Language generation with Transformer-based LLMs
- Music & voice generation (e.g., Suno, ElevenLabs, Bark)

---

## 🧵 Inspiration

Inspired by projects like:
- OpenAI's Generative Models
- Hugging Face Datasets & Models
- DeepLearning.ai’s course on Gen AI
